## What is Computer Vision?
Computer vision is a multidisciplinary field dedicated to empowering computers with the ability to comprehend and interpret visual data, such as images and videos. Its objective is to mimic the human visual system, enabling machines to extract meaningful information from visual inputs. This involves the development of algorithms and models for tasks like image classification, where computers assign labels to images; object detection, which involves locating and identifying multiple objects in an image; and image segmentation, the process of dividing an image into distinct segments. Computer vision applications span various domains, including healthcare, autonomous vehicles, surveillance, and robotics, leveraging techniques from image processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to facilitate the understanding and interpretation of the visual world.

## What was our goal?

The primary objectives of our project were threefold. Firstly, we aimed to showcase the applications of computer vision, particularly in the context of self-driving vehicles, to those who may not be familiar with its use. Secondly, our goal was to disseminate knowledge and provide accessible insights into the fundamentals of computer vision for a broader audience. Lastly, we sought to establish a secure environment for testing and implementing real-world applications, ensuring practicality and safety in our endeavors.
