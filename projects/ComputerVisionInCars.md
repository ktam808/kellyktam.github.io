The project aimed to educate and promote awareness of computer vision's capabilities by showcasing a practical example using mini cars known as Zumis. Leveraging Python programming language, our team coded the Zumi to utilize a front-facing camera for object and color detection. The project's significance lies in its contribution to advancing self-driving car technology and object identification. The Zumi bots served as a foundational model for identifying and locating objects, with potential applications extending to industrial scenarios. By creating a safe testing environment, the project facilitated the exploration and implementation of real-world experiences in a controlled setting.
