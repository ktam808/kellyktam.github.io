## My Experience
Equipped with a camera, telescope, mat, and snacks, I patiently observed the moon's changing cycles throughout the night. The fortunate dispersal of clouds before the Penumbral Eclipse, starting at 10:02 on November 8th, allowed for a clear sky conducive to photography. The moon's surface exhibited a slight dimness, signifying its traversal through Earth's penumbra, the faint outer layer of the planet's shadow. My brothers telescope proved invaluable in zooming into the intricate details of this initial phase. Over an hour later, the Penumbral Eclipse transitioned into the Umbra phase, causing a partial lunar eclipse. The moon, once pearly white, passed through parts of Earth's umbra, the full shadow, resulting from the imperfect alignment of the sun, moon, and earth. At approximately 12:18, the full eclipse unfolded, transforming the moon's color due to Rayleigh scattering.

## Scientific Explanation 
<img align='left' src='https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/nasa-red-1667652223.jfif?resize=660:*' width='300' HSPACE='25' VSPACE='25'> A lunar eclipse is a celestial phenomenon that occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, causing the Earth's shadow to be cast upon the lunar surface. What makes lunar eclipses particularly special is the captivating and often mesmerizing display of colors that can be observed during the event. As the Earth's shadow slowly engulfs the Moon, it undergoes a remarkable transformation, taking on various hues ranging from subtle grays to vibrant oranges and reds. The captivating phenomenon of a Lunar Eclipse involves the moon turning red, reminiscent of the process behind blue skies and crimson sunsets. Rayleigh scattering, where light waves interact differently based on their wavelengths, explains this transformation. The longer wavelengths of red and orange are less likely to scatter, leading to the moon exhibiting hues of crimson red and orange during the eclipse. The phenomenon offers a unique visual spectacle that captures the imagination of sky gazers worldwide. Beyond their visual appeal, lunar eclipses also hold cultural and historical significance, with various societies throughout history attributing different meanings and interpretations to these celestial occurrences. Whether observed for their aesthetic beauty or interpreted through cultural lenses, lunar eclipses continue to be a source of fascination and wonder.
