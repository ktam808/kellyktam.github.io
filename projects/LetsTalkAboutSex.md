Securing first place in the exhibition focused on promoting healthy sexual habits is an experience that has left me genuinely humbled and grateful. The heart of my project was a magazine titled "[Entangled](https://issuu.com/ktam808/docs/wgss_let_s_talk_about_sex_project)." This project aimed to explore the nuanced aspects of fostering a culture of sexual well-being. The insightful evaluation by the esteemed jury, consisting of Dr. Shandhini Raidoo from JABSOM and two colleagues from Planned Parenthood on Maui, provided valuable perspectives that enriched the project's impact. This recognition, rather than a personal achievement, represents a collective effort to raise awareness about the importance of healthy sexual habits in our community. I am sincerely appreciative of the opportunity to contribute to this vital conversation.
