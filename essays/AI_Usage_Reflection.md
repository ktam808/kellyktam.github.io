### I. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly transformed the landscape of education, particularly in technical disciplines like Software Engineering. In courses such as ICS 314, the integration of AI tools and methodologies has revolutionized the learning experience, offering students unprecedented opportunities for exploration, experimentation, and innovation. As we navigate the complexities of modern software development, AI has become an indispensable ally, accelerating knowledge acquisition, fostering creative problem-solving approaches, and enriching comprehension through diverse perspectives. In this essay, I will delve into my personal journey with AI in ICS 314, detailing the specific tools and methodologies utilized and examining their profound implications on my learning, understanding, and application of software engineering principles.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18 <br>
Experience WODs are not necessarily graded based on how quickly I complete them, and I am given as many tries as needed to understand the material and the process. AI doesn't necessarily play a role in this process. If I fail a couple of attempts, I keep trying until I fully grasp the material and how everything works.
     
  2. In-class Practice WODs <br>
Since the in-class practice WODs aren't graded, they provide me with an opportunity to review and reinforce lessons on my own. I don't seek help from AI during this time because it's important for me to identify areas where I need further review or practice. This allows me to focus on what I need to revisit and improve.
     
  3. In-class WODs <br>
During the in-class WODs, I sometimes encounter problems with my code. Since these are timed and graded based on how quickly I can understand and complete the tasks, AI has been a helpful resource. When I can't identify the error or improve my code on my own, I turn to a chatbot for assistance. I ask it to analyze the errors and provide insights to help me pinpoint what went wrong.
     
  4. Essays <br>
When it comes to essays, I like to use ChatGPT to double-check spelling and grammar. For example, I asked ChatGPT to review this essay for any mistakes I may have missed during my own review. This makes the editing process easier, especially for mistakes I may have accidentally overlooked.
     
  5. Final project <br>
AI has definitely made my final project easier. My team and I decided to use FullCalendar, which was entirely new to us. I must admit I was far from an expert in its various functions and features. Whenever I encountered an error with the calendar, I often spent hours browsing the FullCalendar website, trying to understand what went wrong and how I could fix it. Sometimes I got overwhelmed by the extensive functions and large data sets. In those moments, I turned to AI for help in identifying the problem and suggesting solutions. It made learning FullCalendar significantly easier. I remember sitting in class after spending the entire day trying to figure out why the calendar wasn't pulling data from our collection. Despite scouring the internet for answers, I found none. That’s when I turned to ChatGPT, and after about four prompts, it quickly solved the problem and helped me get the data to pull correctly. Of course, I needed to understand what I did wrong, and it turned out that I lacked knowledge of a conversion function I had never learned before. This function adjusted the input data to a format that FullCalendar could read. ChatGPT was truly a lifesaver.
     
  6. Learning a concept / tutorial <br>
Sometimes concepts can be challenging for me, even the simplest ones. I remember in this class and others where I would ask ChatGPT to explain a concept in 'elementary' or 'preschool' terms. For example, design patterns were completely new to me. When I first encountered the essay assignment on design patterns, I mistakenly thought the professors wanted me to write about my favorite colors, fonts, or decorative designs for use in class. Fortunately, I went online to clarify what design patterns actually meant, which saved me from submitting a wildly different essay. I tried reading articles and watching YouTube videos to understand the concept of design patterns, but none of them made sense to me. So, I turned to ChatGPT and asked, 'Can you please explain to me in elementary and preschool terms what design patterns are in computer science and provide examples?' ChatGPT responded within a minute, giving examples like building houses with Legos or making pizza with different chefs. I literally understood the concept through ChatGPT's explanations, which helped me grasp the different patterns and how to apply them.

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord <br>
I don't often answer questions on the Discord channel. However, if I am certain about an answer because I had the same question and found the answer myself, I am more than willing to help someone out. For questions in class, I only turn to AI if I'm unsure of the answer and can't find helpful resources online.

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question <br>
Answering smart-questions can be challenging for me, and I think this is true in general. If I have already found the answer on my own, I am happy to help others solve their coding problems as well. However, I usually avoid asking or answering advanced questions because I may not fully understand what is being asked or I may not be certain of the answer.

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck” <br>
I seek coding examples not only in ICS 314 but also in my other classes. When I learn a new function or shortcut, I search online for coding examples to find ideas on how to integrate them into my own code. If the online examples are too complex, I ask a chatbot for a simpler example.
     
  10. Explaining code <br>
Sometimes, when I review coding answers or examples, I get confused. If I recognize how my code should look or understand the expected outcome, I try to grasp the explanation thoroughly. For any parts I don't fully understand, I may input them into a chatbot and ask for clarification on why that specific code was used and what its purpose is.

  11. Writing code <br>
A great example of this is the final project. When I struggled to understand how to work with FullCalendar's design components, I turned to ChatGPT. I asked it to write code for me that would modify specific areas of the calendar.

  12. Documenting code <br>
Since I want to understand what my code does in my own words, I don't usually turn to AI or chatbots to write code documentations. I think it would confuse me down the line cause my understanding of the code and the way that I word it to my understanding would get confused by how a chatbot might write it. 

  13. Quality assurance <br>
I definitely use AI for quality assurance. I appreciate that ChatGPT and other AI chatbots can review my code or writing and offer suggestions for improvement. While I know their responses may not always be correct, I always double-check and decide whether to accept the suggested changes. Despite this, AI chatbots and tools are undeniably helpful for reviewing my code, grammar, spelling, and overall flow.

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above <br>
There aren't any other uses I can think of besides the ones listed above.
